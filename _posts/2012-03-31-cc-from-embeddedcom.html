This deserves a separate post. Here's some C/C++ embedded tutorials from Dan Saks which i really enjoy reading and always get back to them when I have a spare time. I include a link for all articles which he has published on the embedded.com. <br /><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-blogs/27/Programming-Pointers">Embedded.com - Programming Pointers - Dan Saks</a><br /><br />Beginner's corner (collection of articles) short list but worth reading:<br /><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/EELife/BlogCollection/4210357?pageNumber=1">Embedded.com - Beginner's Corner</a><br /><br /></div>
