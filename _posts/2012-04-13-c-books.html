I've purchased books quite regular since last year.<br /><br />I include a list of C language book recommendations, I haven't read them all so far, I intend to. I grabbed C puzzle book last weekend and had fun with some exercises which seem to be easy but tricky sometimes. My all-time favorite is K&amp;R which helped me quite a lot.<br /><br /><a href="http://knking.com/recbooks/c.html">C language book recommendation</a></div>
