I bet everybody out there went at least once to the interview. There are many sites which could help you with preparation and even though I haven't went to any at least few months, i check some questions sometimes only for fun and to improve the creativity and expand the knowledge.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.indiabix.com/technical/c/">C programming questions and answers [indiabix.com]</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.rmbconsulting.us/a-c-test-the-0x10-best-questions-for-would-be-embedded-programmers">0x10 best interview questions [rmbconsulting.us]</a><br />I consider this as a classic in my eyes. I remember i run into the 0x10 list when i was not able to answer few of those if not all :) <br /><br /><a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glass Door [glassdoor.com]</a><br />This one is a bit different, it contains information about the salaries, job interview questions for an exact position. Worth to register and check it out!<br /><br />I'll expand this list by time.</div>
