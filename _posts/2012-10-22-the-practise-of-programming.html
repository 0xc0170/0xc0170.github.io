I have bought another book - The Practice of Programming from B. W. Kernighan and Rob Pike. I haven't finished reading but so far seems to be pleasant reading <br /><br /><a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/11/30/book-review-the-practice-of-programming-by-kernighan-pike/">Eli Bendersky [eli.thegreenplace.net/]</a><br />I was reading this blog when I discovered what I have missed in my collection and immediately ordered my own copy. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.bamsoftware.com/computers/tpop-answers.html">Answers to The Practise of Programming [bamsoftware.com/computers]</a><br />Answers to the exercises in the book. Can't confirm about the quality yet.<br /><br />I'll review it once I finish reading. </div>
