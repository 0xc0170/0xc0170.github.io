I've been wondering always how to implement filter in C language. There was a time when I just copied one IIR filter and tuned it to my needs but did not bother with discovering more about it and implement my own one. This springs back when I have to test a part where are few filters applied. <br /><br />I have started with IIR and low pass filters. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?p=1245">Fixed Point Scaling [rowetel.com/blog]</a><br />This one explains simple low pass filter and provides octave file which helps me really weLL.&nbsp; I will come back with octave topics later.<br /><a href="http://www.dsprelated.com/showmessage/47981/1.php">What is moving avarage filter? [dsprelated.com]</a><br />DSPrelated is the one which I visit when I look for digital signal processing. Articles, forum with many experienced users. <br /><a href="http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~kaestner/es0203/lecthr05.pdf">Introduction to Digital Filters [rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~kaestner]</a><br /><br /><a href="http://helpful.knobs-dials.com/index.php/Low-pass_filter">Low pass filter [helpful.knobs-dials.com]</a><br />This is moving avarage filter with code. Simple which enables reader to understand it quickly.</div>
