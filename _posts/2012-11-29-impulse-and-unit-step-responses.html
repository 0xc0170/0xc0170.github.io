I posted yesterday post about IIR filters but totally missed the topic which I should have started with. It's about systems responses. I had finally some time to document filters we use in code.<br /><br /><a href="http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Transient/TransInputs/TransStep.html">The Unit Step Response [lpsa.swarthmore.edu]</a><br />Link directs to the unit step response. There's tab also with the impulse response. All explained with introduction and equations followed by pictures. <br />Website's name is Linear Physical System Analysis. Recommended to read !</div>
