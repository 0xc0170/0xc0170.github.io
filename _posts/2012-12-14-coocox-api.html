I have been spending my leasure time with CooCox library. They provide CoIDE, CoFlash and Cox library. CoIDE is simple and fast to set up, possible to use J-link, OpenSDA and many more. I was worried in the beginning because of eclipse and some experience with other IDE which I was not fond of :) It turned out great, eventhough it is still under development.<br />The source code is on GitHub and forum is alive. <br /><br />CooCox supports Cortex M0 and Cortex M3 so far. Next step is to try their CoOS, but that has to wait a bit. Still many areas to explore in their interface. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.coocox.org/">CooCox website [coocox.org]</a></div>
