I was reading one post about which book you should not buy and realized I have not shared any websites which ultimately can narrow down the search. I normally check some blogs with reviews, accu webpage and amazon rating and google book preview before I purchase a book.<br /><br /><a href="http://accu.org/index.php?module=bookreviews&amp;func=search">Books review [accu.org]</a><br />More than 1800 reviews. I would start with this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/users/yechiel/CS/ChoosingBooks.html">A few tips for choosing C and C++ books [cs.technion.ac.il/users/yechiel/CS]</a><br />Hints for choosing proper book. Links are at the bottom of the page where is list of bad C/C++ books.<br /><br />I even tried to read some on my kindle but I prefer paper books for this type of reading. More posts about books should arrive.</div>
