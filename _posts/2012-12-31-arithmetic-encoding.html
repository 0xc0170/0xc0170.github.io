Based on the previous post, I can't stop until I implement my own arithmetic coding. The worse is I don't have my laptop with me, therefore I only have read articles and tried encoding/decoding on the paper. Which is slightly harder if numbers used are fixed point and want to imitate how C program should work. These 3 pages helped me most to understand the problem.<br /><br /><a href="http://michael.dipperstein.com/arithmetic/">Arithmetic Code [michael.dipperstein.com]</a><br /><a href="http://www.arturocampos.com/ac_arithmetic.html">Basic arithmetic coding [arturocampos.com]</a><br /><a href="http://webspace.ulbsibiu.ro/macarie.breazu/ACM/LabArithmCoding.pdf">Arithmetic coding how to [pdf] [webspace.ulbsibiu.ro/macarie.breazu]</a></div>
