I finally found some time to explore another RTOS, this time it's CoOS. My KL25 freedom board will be great board for this purpose. <br />I have played with their CoX library in the beginning, tested all demos and how their code looks like, but I wanted to move to RTOS anyway.<br /><br /><a href="http://polisoftdesign.com/2010/04/22/coos-real-time-kernel-coocox-org-part-1/">CoOS RTOS [polisoftdesign.com]</a><br />Some introduction (part1-part3) to CoOS RTOS. </div>
