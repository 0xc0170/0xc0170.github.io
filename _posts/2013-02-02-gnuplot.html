<div class='post'>
There was a demand to process all testing data and generate graphs. There was a perl script to process everything but was outdated. To plot the graphs it used GNUplot. I found lack of documentation, although everything I found on the internet (blogs, stackoverflow). What my parser required was to use multiplot to generate 3 rows and 2 colums graphs, read data from files.&nbsp; The each column has to have own title above them. <br /><br />GNUplot is really powerful and I will be happy to use it once again.<br /><br /></div>
