I usually create libraries with an extension .a or .lib. As I glanced at mbed, their own library has extension .ar. KEIL comes with <a href="http://www.keil.com/arm/realview.asp">ARM Compilation Tools [www.keil.com]</a>), which is used also for embed library, as I believe.<br /><br />To compile files from which we want to create a library (target is Cortex-M0+).<br /><pre class="brush: python">armcc --cpu=Cortex-M0plus --no_debug -c file1 file2 fileXY<br /></pre><br />To create static library from object files<br /><pre class="brush: python">armar --rv archive_name object_file1 object_file2 object_fileXY<br /></pre><br />I successfully imported small static library to mbed and run it on my mbed board. There are many options to select.
