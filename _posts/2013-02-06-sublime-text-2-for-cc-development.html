<div class='post'>
I've decided to use VIM for my development. Although I installed it long time ago, I have not gave it a shot. On the other hand, I started using Sublime. The beginning was like notepad++ feeling, what does sublime offer more, I marveled. That's been itching my conscience and therefore I watched few tutorials and opened Sublime Text Cheat Sheet. Since that moment, I've pleasantly been using it with much more effectivity. Here I present most used shortcuts which makes my development faster ( take it as is, because I am still learning).<br /><br />This document covers a lot, but I recommend to watch tutorials<br /><a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/">Tutplus.com Sublime [tutsplus.com]</a><br /><br />After you complete it, check this and write down (memorize) which you consider important. <br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/zNGeEifW">Sublime Text Cheat [pastebin.com]</a><br /><br />Plugins make sublime powerful, I use so far these - Linter (with cppcheck), CodeIntel, Bracket Highlighter.<br /><br />The only problem I had, was to set up cppcheck in Linter, paste this into user settings for Linter (path to cppcheck)<br /><pre class="brush: python">{<br /><br />"sublimelinter": "load-save",<br /><br />"sublimelinter_executable_map": {<br /><br />"c" : "C:/Program Files/Cppcheck/cppcheck.exe",<br /><br />"c++" : "C:/Program Files/Cppcheck/cppcheck.exe"<br /><br />},<br /><br />"sublimelinter_gutter_marks": true,<br /><br />"sublimelinter_popup_errors_on_save": true,<br /><br />"sublimelinter": "save-only"<br /><br />}<br /><br /></pre><br />Happy coding and don't use a mouse, use a keyboard with shortcuts!<br /><br /></div>
