I have posted here links which were dedicated to the multiplication and division. I had to get back to it today because was not sure what does constant mean in one assembly code (0x199A).<br /><br /><a href="http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/divide.html">Reciprocal Multiplication [homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones]</a> <br />Here was the answer to that constant, why to use fixed point arithmetic on dividing, also explanation why 0xCCCD is used to calculate 1/10 of a value.<br /><br />I am glad it brought up the topic back and I had to revise it. </div>
