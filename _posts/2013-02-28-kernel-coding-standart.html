Kernel coding standard published on kernel.org differs from others by style which is used there. It made me smiled during reading, following lines are copied from it :<br /><br /><pre>"However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a<br />less-than-gifted first-year high-school student might not even<br />understand what the function is all about"</pre><br />Overall, there are many "weak" points highlighted there which should be considered. <br /><br /><a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/CodingStyle?id=refs/heads/master">Coding style [kernel.org]</a></div>
