I am still waiting for my GoF book to arrive, thus I have to read some articles.. This time I was curious about singleton design pattern, there's a user type object in my application which has to be only one. To implement simple singleton, I chose Scott Mayers Singleton (from Effective C++).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.vladislavonline.com/cpp-singleton-implementation/">C++ Singleton Implementation [vladislavonline.com]</a><br />Here's comparison between GoF implementation and Scott Mayer's.<br /><br /><a href="http://silviuardelean.ro/2012/06/05/few-singleton-approaches/">Several C++ singleton implementations [silviuardelean.ro]</a><br />4 approaches presented, but scott mayers is slighty different, because copy and assignment are defined, which is not the original version.<br /><br />Anyway, the best reference is the book Modern C++ Design. Chapter 6 contains information about implementation of Singleton, how to handle destroying it and also multi threaded application concern.<br />In case you don't have a copy of the book, this presentation uses sources from it, check it out:<br /><a href="http://www10.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Teaching/Courses/SS2011/CPP/krautwurm.pdf">Singleton C++ [www10.informatik.uni-erlangen.de]</a></div>
