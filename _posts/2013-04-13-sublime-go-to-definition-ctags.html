One of the two features I really appreciate during a development - Go to the definition. I had downloaded Ctags plugin but it did not work out of the box only because I did not know about downloading CTags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net).<br /><br />Once you extract files, add a path to CTags in PATH inside Enviroment variables (for instance ;C:/Program Files/ctags). Open command line and type ctags. If an output is ctags: No files specified, we can proceed to the Sublime. <br /><br />Click on any project opened in file browser there, first option should be CTags Rebuild tags. CTags creates two files in your project .tags_sorted_by_file and .tags. Use shortcut to GO TO THE DEFINITION is by default CTRL+SHIFT+. in windows. Awesome!</div>
