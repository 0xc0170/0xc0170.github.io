While I was checking books which I would like to buy, I found these two webpages which share literature about C/embedded/signals.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.keil.com/books/">Keil embedded bookshelf [keil.com/books]</a><br />&nbsp;I had to ordered another two new books which I have not read yet, ARM assembly language and ARM system developer's guide. I can't wait to read them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=22514">AVR freaks - Online C books and Tools [avrfreaks.net]</a><br />Rich list of many tutorials, books mostly for C lang, AVR related.</div>
