<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/bugs.html">How to report bugs effectively [www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham]</a><br />This essay is a classic ! I did not bookmark it last time I had read it, it's worth to have it always by hand.<br /><br />I should probably inspire myself and write something similar for our community. A user shares frequently details in a manner: "It does not work, please help me."<br /><br />No platform, compiler or the line of code or at least function where it crashed or surprisingly returns an unexpected value.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
