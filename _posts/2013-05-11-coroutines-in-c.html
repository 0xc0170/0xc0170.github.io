I downloaded Contiki for educational purposes, and first thing which got me trapped are protothreads. I have never read anything about coroutines (yes, blame on me not to read Donald Knuth's books - I'll get to those once I empty my bookshelf).&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" title="Donald Knuth"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Coroutines in C [chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham]</a><br />Excellent article to the point, with examples and explanations.<br /><br /><a href="http://fanf.livejournal.com/105413.html">Coroutines in less than 20 lines of standard C [fanf.livejournal.com]</a><br />Tony Finch's coroutines which uses setjmp and longjmp for saving the state and jumping to new coroutine.<br /><br /><a href="http://dunkels.com/adam/pt/index.html">Protothreads [dunkels.com/adam/pt]</a><br />Main page for protothreads, if any questions, answer is there probably. Check examples there, or directly contiki implementation.<br /><br /></div>
