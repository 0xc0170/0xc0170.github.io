Just a tiny update, I received two new boards in the last 3 weeks. That's why I haven't got time to write more tutorials, neither to port some freedom boards. More you want to achieve, less time you have left :)<br /><br />The first board was the application mbed board, very first NXP chip on my desk. I tested mqtt which did not work due to server problems, some ethernet applications. I'll get closer look at mqtt in the upcoming weeks.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_rfBgf28loo/UiipQ0foVTI/AAAAAAAAC4s/g3Zgen7fLjc/s1600/mbed.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_rfBgf28loo/UiipQ0foVTI/AAAAAAAAC4s/g3Zgen7fLjc/s320/mbed.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />The second board was the Wi-Go board (cc3000). It is already supported in mbed although cc3000 is not complete yet.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcqqciQmDE8/UiipSP6LpAI/AAAAAAAAC40/QKMOSRO-gA8/s1600/wi-go.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dcqqciQmDE8/UiipSP6LpAI/AAAAAAAAC40/QKMOSRO-gA8/s320/wi-go.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>I am currently rewriting cc3000 driver and will be available on mbed soon. I'll share more with you later. </div>
