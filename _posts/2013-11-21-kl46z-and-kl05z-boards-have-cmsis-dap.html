<br />I have spent my last evenings with CMSIS-DAP, mostly with the interface layer. There has been some motion in CMSIS-DAP recently. The master branch already contains these 2 interfaces.<br /><br />After porting mbed SDK to those 2 freedom boards, this was on my todo list as a final step. They should be tested, both SDK and also CMSIS-DAP, then enabled on mbed. Can't wait to see these 2 boards online.<br /><br />I can come back to the freedom board K20D50M and its mbed SDK implementation. Also what I would like to do, start with pyOCD.</div>
