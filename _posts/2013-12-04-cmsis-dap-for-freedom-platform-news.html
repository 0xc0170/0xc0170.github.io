As many of you know, I recently added new freedom platforms to CMSIS-DAP, with help from the mbed team and also bigarmer2013.<br /><br />I built today the CMSIS-DAP for the following boards:<br /><ul><li>KL05Z</li><li>KL25Z</li><li>KL46Z</li><li>K20D50M</li></ul>You can download them here&nbsp;<a href="http://mbed.org/users/Kojto/notebook/cmsis-dap-for-the-freedom-platform-kl05-kl25-kl46-/">CMSIS-DAP for the freedom platform [mbed.org/users/Kojto/notebook]</a> <br /><br />Be aware, they are for testing purposes at the moment <br /><br />If you have any problems, report them on mbed site, preferably in the notebook comments.
