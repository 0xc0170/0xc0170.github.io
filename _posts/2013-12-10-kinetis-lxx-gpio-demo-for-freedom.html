Quick update.<br />I introduced yesterday KLxx project with only one freedom board supported - KL25Z.<br /><br />I have added 3 more boards - KL02Z, KL05Z and KL46Z. Current version is v0.3. As version states, still needs more testing.<br /><br />On github: <a href="https://github.com/0xc0170/kinetis_klxx_gcc">Kinetis KLxx gpio demo - GCC [github.com/0xc0170]</a></div>
