Some of you might have noticed that KL46Z was stripped from platforms. Wonder why?<br /><br />The CMSIS-DAP interface was functional. However, it sets randomly the security bit or even disabled mass erase bit. With help from the mbed team, we corrected it.<br /><br />I updated my notepad page on mbed, the CMSIS-DAP v2 for KL46Z is shared there.<br /><a href="http://mbed.org/users/Kojto/notebook/cmsis-dap-for-the-freedom-platform-kl05-kl25-kl46-/">CMSIS-DAP for the freedom platform [mbed.org/users/Kojto/notebook]</a></div>
