Is anybody out there who wants to participate in enabling those 2 platforms? I posted instructions how to debug KL05Z target offline with mbed sources few weeks ago. However, I did not receive any feedback if that is working for you or any problems with its implementation.<br /><br />The fresh new target K20D50M is still not complete, thus needed some more tweaks to complete its implementation. <br /><br />Here's a post from mbed, good place to start:&nbsp; <a href="http://mbed.org/forum/mbed/topic/4666/">Let's enable KL05Z and K20D5M targets online on mbed [mbed.org/forum/mbed]</a><br />Leave a comment, preferably there on mbed community.</div>
