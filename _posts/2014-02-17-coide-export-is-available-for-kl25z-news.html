My latest article was how to use CoIDE with C++. I added exporters for CoIDE to mbed. I was able to make it work for KL25Z, KL05Z (not yet online on mbed.org site, will be soon). LCP1768 is functional but not through CMSIS-DAP, due to a problem which was reported to CoIDE team a while ago.<br /><br />The exporter is online in the mbed compiler, see picture below. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dHgmZZaGJoQ/UwJu5EcEf_I/AAAAAAAAEtM/LgwIU056-ow/s1600/CoIDE+exporters.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dHgmZZaGJoQ/UwJu5EcEf_I/AAAAAAAAEtM/LgwIU056-ow/s1600/CoIDE+exporters.JPG" height="265" width="320" /></a></div><br />Enjoy using CooCox CoIDE with KL25Z and mbed! If there are any problems, please report them on the mbed site, or just here in comments.</div>
