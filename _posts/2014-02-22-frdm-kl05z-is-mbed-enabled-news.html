The FRDM-KL05Z board was my first target added to mbed. I would even say that was my initial experience with mbed sources. That was back in June 2013. It was added to mbed.org yesterday. This became 3rd Freescale board available on mbed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/sam_grove/frdm-kl05z_pinmap1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/sam_grove/frdm-kl05z_pinmap1.jpg" height="230" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-KL05Z/">FRDM-KL05Z [mbed.org/platforms]</a><br /><br />It supports export to ARM GCC, uVision and CoIDE.<br /><br />Paul Staron shared an info about low power modes and his power measurements. Not possible to carry out on FRDM board though. Here's a link for more information <a href="http://mbed.org/forum/platform-40-FRDM-KL05Z-community/topic/4750/">FRDM-KL05Z sleep modes and RTC [mbed.org/forum]</a><br /><br /></div>
