I haven't written any blog lately. The reason (for some it can be an excuse) is that I have been porting the new target to the mbed. It's FRDM-K64F which has been announced during FTF 2014.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/sam_grove/k64f_arduino.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/sam_grove/k64f_arduino.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The link to the platform page to get more information&nbsp; : <a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/">FRDM-K64F</a><br />The mbed ethernet support is not yet ready, will be available soon.<br /><br />EnjoY! <br /><br /></div>
