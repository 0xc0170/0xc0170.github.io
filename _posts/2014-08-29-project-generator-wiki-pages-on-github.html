I am currently writing wiki pages for the project generator. If you are interested in the project, read it and provide feedback.<br />The link <a href="https://github.com/0xc0170/project_generator/wiki">Project generator -  Wiki pages [github.com/0xc0170/project_generator/wiki]</a><br /><br />I am going to merge IAR options once I finish and test them, currently implementation on the branch. It takes longer time than uVision, as IAR has many separate options.<br />I finished the release of v0.1 this week, created a new tasks for v0.2. <br /><br />My focus in the v0.2 will be on documentation, stabilize uVision, IAR and creating one generic Makefile for GCC toolchains.</div>
