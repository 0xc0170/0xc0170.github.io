The very first post published only on this website. I moved from blogger to github pages. A reason? I have been thinking about my own webpage for a while. The trigger happened when I found out about github pages. As a result, I couldn't resist longer.
The site sources are on [my github account](https://github.com/0xc0170/0xc0170.github.io)

All previous blogger posts were ported so there can be a mismatch, although I went through all of them. Report if there's a problem.

If you have a topic you would like me to cover (for instance regarding mbed, pyOCD or project generator or anything else I can answer), shoot in a comment.
