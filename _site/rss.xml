&lt;p&gt;I decided to move from blogspot to github. The main reason I was not writing that often on blogspot was that I joined mbed team.
I set this page as my personal webpage, and might turn it into blog. Hope it is accessible to anyone and will provide content which might interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
