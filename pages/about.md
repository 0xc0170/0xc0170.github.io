Usually known as 0xc0170 which as many people ask what does it mean. The answer? My nickname in a hexadecimal code (aka Kojto).

My main interest in my spare time are open source communities, helping various projects to expand to new targets, fixing bugs, interact with users, creating new software libraries and writing tutorials.

I am currently working on ARM mbed project and other related projects.

If you want to contact me via email, you can find it in git log in the projects I contributed to.
